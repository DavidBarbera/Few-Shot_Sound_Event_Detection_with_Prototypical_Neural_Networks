# Few-Shot Sound Event Detection with Prototypical Neural Networks
Study in using Metric-based Meta Learning for Sound Event Detection. It is based in the following two articles:  

1. Wang, Y., Salamon, J., Bryan, N. J., & Pablo Bello, J. (2020). Few-Shot Sound Event Detection. ICASSP 2020
2. Snell, J., Swersky, K., & Zemel, R. (2017). Prototypical Networks for Few-shot Learning. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems

   <b>Note: Works and Tested in my computer. However, as I am creating this repo open source there is still some work in progress. Requires:</b>
   1. Finish Readme
   2. Installation instructions
   3. Scripts to Download and preprocess SWC corpora to recreate experiment.
   4. Reproduces similar Wang et al. 2020 results for Prototypical Neural Networks despite using different split sets.
